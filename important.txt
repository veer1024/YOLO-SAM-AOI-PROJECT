CURRENT FLAW:

 Building footprint detection is not 100 % accurate, there are some flaw in code logic leading in 85% footprint detection accuracy.

 Noises: in each run usually 5-6% noises are detected in output ( model retraining required)


 PROS:

 1. Height detection is more then 90% accurate. ( more R&D and data optimization required)
 2. GLB/GEOGSON export import make solution portable.
 3. no gpu required to run this.
